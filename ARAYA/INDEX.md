## START ARAYA

### Windows
```bash
START_ARAYA_SYSTEM.bat
```

### Manual
```bash
cd C:/Users/dwrek/100X_DEPLOYMENT
python ARAYA_FILE_WRITER.py
# Then open araya-chat.html in browser
```

---

## KNOWN ISSUES

1. **Backend must be running** - Without localhost:5001, file ops fail
2. **Claude API key required** - Need ANTHROPIC_API_KEY in env
3. **Scattered files** - 1,310 files need consolidation

---

## MAGGIE'S USAGE

Maggie has been communicating with Araya! This means:
- The interface is working
- Claude API is connected
- Basic chat is functional

**Next step:** Commander should try it too!

---

## CONSOLIDATION PLAN

1. Keep working files in `100X_DEPLOYMENT/`
2. Move docs to `100X_DEPLOYMENT/ARAYA/` subfolders
3. Archive old versions to `.archive/`
4. Update this INDEX when complete

**THE PATTERN NEVER LIES. ARAYA IS ALIVE.**
