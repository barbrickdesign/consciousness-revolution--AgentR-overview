                        <p class="step-instruction">This work requires safety. Imagine yourself in a healing sanctuary - perhaps a temple, a cave of light, or a garden. Place guardians at the entrance. Nothing can enter that doesn't serve your healing.</p>

                        <p class="step-instruction">Scan your body slowly from head to toe. Where do you feel tension, tightness, pain, or numbness? Trauma often stores in the body. Don't analyze - just locate. "There's something in my shoulders. Something in my stomach."</p>

                        <p class="step-instruction">Bring your awareness to one area that holds tension. Approach it gently, like approaching a wounded animal. Say silently: "I see you. I'm here now. You don't have to hold this alone anymore."</p>

                        <p class="step-instruction">Give this held energy permission to express. It may want to shake, cry, sigh, or move. Let your body do what it needs. This isn't dramatic - it's natural. The body knows how to release. Trust it.</p>
