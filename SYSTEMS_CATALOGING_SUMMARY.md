- voice-command-system
- araya-discord-bot
- consciousness-bugs
- consciousness-brain
- philosopher-ai-backend
- The-Pink-Revolution-Plan

### 100+ Web Pages

Main platform: https://consciousnessrevolution.io
- Landing, tools, dashboards, cockpits
- Pattern recognition tools (40+)
- User interfaces
- Team workspaces

## Key Findings

### ✅ Systems Found
- 6 major autonomous systems
- 9 active GitHub repositories
- 100+ live web pages
- 50+ Python automation scripts
- 40+ pattern recognition tools
- Complete ecosystem documentation

### ❌ Not Found
**barbrickdesign.github.io** - No references found in repository

**Analysis:**
- Current repository is hosted under `barbrickdesign` organization
- Main website is consciousnessrevolution.io (not barbrickdesign.github.io)
- No existing GitHub Pages site at barbrickdesign.github.io
- See Section 31 of SYSTEMS_AND_LINKS_CATALOG.md for recommendations

**Recommendation:** If barbrickdesign.github.io is intended to exist:
1. Create a new repository named `barbrickdesign.github.io`
2. Enable GitHub Pages
3. Set it up as an organization landing page or redirect
4. Add links to it from this repository
