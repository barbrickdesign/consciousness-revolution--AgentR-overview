## PATTERN THEORY APPLICATION

**3 Products** → **7 Domain Coverage** → **13 Harmonic Pricing** → **∞ Revenue Growth**

### 3 Products (Base Pattern)
- Founding Member (accessible entry)
- Pro (value upgrade)
- Emergency (high-ticket)

### 7 Domain Coverage
Each product delivers value across all 7 domains:
1. COMMAND (dashboard access)
2. BUILD (tools + training)
3. CONNECT (community)
4. PROTECT (pattern defense)
5. GROW (business application)
6. LEARN (courses + content)
7. TRANSCEND (consciousness evolution)

### 13 Harmonic Pricing
- $47 = 4+7 = 11 (master number)
- $99 = 9+9 = 18 → 1+8 = 9 (completion)
- $500 = 5+0+0 = 5 (transformation)

### ∞ Revenue Scaling
- Subscription = recurring infinity
- Each member = force multiplier
- Network effects = exponential growth
