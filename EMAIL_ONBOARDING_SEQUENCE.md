```
[Name],

Sarah was a solopreneur getting destroyed by clients.

Scope creep. Late payments. Constant revisions.

Classic destroyer patterns.

She joined Consciousness Revolution beta. Here's what happened:

DAY 1: Took the pattern quiz. Scored 23% manipulation immunity.
DAY 3: Learned the "Pattern Theory" framework. Started seeing manipulation everywhere.
DAY 5: Used "7 Domains" to analyze her worst client. MIND. BLOWN.
DAY 7: Set boundaries. Fired toxic client. Raised rates 40%.

Her immunity score today? 87%.

Her words: "I can't believe I was blind for 10 years."

## 📧 EMAIL 4: Value Bomb (72 hours)

**Subject:** The 3 manipulation patterns destroying builders (and how to stop them)

**Content:**
```
[Name],

After analyzing 10,000+ builder interactions, we found the 3 deadliest manipulation patterns:

🚨 PATTERN #1: The Scope Creeper
"Just one more small thing..." → Unpaid work spiral
DEFENSE: Set hard boundaries upfront

🚨 PATTERN #2: The Payment Delayer
"We'll pay once we see more results..." → Cash flow death
DEFENSE: 50% upfront, always

🚨 PATTERN #3: The Complexity Creator
"It's more complicated than we thought..." → Endless revisions
DEFENSE: Fixed scope contracts

These patterns cost builders $10K-$50K per year.

Here's the antidote: [Download Pattern Defense Playbook]

Inside:
✓ 23 manipulation patterns (with examples)
✓ Exact scripts to shut them down
✓ Warning signs checklist
✓ Builder protection templates
