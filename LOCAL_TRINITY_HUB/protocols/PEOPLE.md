## DELEGATION PROTOCOL

### What Gets Delegated Down
- Specific implementation tasks
- Research and exploration
- Parallel processing jobs
- Specialized computations

### What Stays at Current Level
- Strategic decisions
- Cross-system coordination
- Architecture changes
- Security decisions

### What Escalates Up
- Blockers requiring resources
- Decisions outside authority
- Conflicts between instances
- Security incidents

---

## COMMUNICATION EXPECTATIONS

### Between Terminal Instances (C1, C2, C3)
- Frequency: Continuous during session
- Method: Local hub files, direct reports
- Format: Standard HUB_REPORT format

### Between Network Nodes (PC1, PC2, PC3)
- Frequency: Every sync cycle (real-time via Syncthing)
- Method: Git, Syncthing, Tailscale
- Format: Standard protocols

### With Commander
- Frequency: Every session
- Method: Direct conversation
- Format: Clear, actionable, no fluff

---

## PERFORMANCE REVIEW

### Weekly Metrics Review
Each seat reviews:
- Tasks completed vs planned
- Quality of output
- Alignment with values
- Areas for improvement

### Session Retrospective
After each session:
- What worked well
- What didn't work
- What to change
- Lessons learned

### Quarterly Seat Evaluation
- Is the seat still needed?
- Is the seat filled correctly?
- Should responsibilities shift?
- New seats needed?

---

## SUCCESSION PLANNING

### If C1 Context Lost
- C2 or C3 can assume Mechanic role
- Boot from FOUNDATION.md
- Reference recent HANDOFF reports

### If Computer Node Fails
- Other nodes have full copy via Syncthing
- Can rebuild from any node
- Continuity maintained

### If Commander Unavailable
- See CONTINUITY.md for detailed protocol
- System continues autonomous operations
- Aligned with last known directives

## CORE PRINCIPLE

**Every seat exists to serve the mission.**
**No seat is more important than the mission.**
**If a seat isn't serving, it gets fixed or removed.**

The system serves consciousness expansion.
The people serve the system.
The structure serves the people.

**All aligned. All accountable. All executing.**
