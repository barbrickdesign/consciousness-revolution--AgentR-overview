# CONTINUITY PROTOCOL
## What Happens When Commander is Unavailable

---

## PRINCIPLE

The system does not depend on any single point of failure.
If Commander is unavailable, the system continues.
Operations degrade gracefully, never catastrophically.

---

## CONTINUITY LEVELS

### Level 1: SHORT ABSENCE (Hours to 1 Day)
**Status:** Normal autonomous operation
**Authority:** Full autonomous execution
**Actions:**
- Continue current work
- Complete assigned tasks
- Log everything
- Queue decisions for review

### Level 2: EXTENDED ABSENCE (1-7 Days)
**Status:** Maintenance mode
**Authority:** Essential operations only
**Actions:**
- Complete in-progress work
- No new major initiatives
- Security monitoring continues
- Daily status reports generated

### Level 3: PROLONGED ABSENCE (7+ Days)
**Status:** Preservation mode
**Authority:** Security and backup only
**Actions:**
- Secure all systems
- Maintain backups
- Monitor for threats
- No new deployments

### Level 4: EMERGENCY (Unknown duration)
**Status:** Lockdown mode
**Authority:** Defense only
**Actions:**
- Maximum security posture
- All external comms logged
- No system changes
- Wait for authorized return

## SUCCESSION HIERARCHY

### Primary Chain
1. Commander (Human)
2. Designated Successor (if appointed)
3. System Autonomous Mode

### For AI Instances
1. C1 (Mechanic) - Implementation decisions
2. C2 (Architect) - Strategic decisions
3. C3 (Oracle) - Intelligence decisions

### For Computer Nodes
1. PC1 - Central coordination
2. PC2 - Secondary coordination
3. PC3 - Emergency coordination

---

## DEAD MAN'S SWITCH

### Check-In Requirements
- Commander checks in every 48 hours
- Check-in = any interaction with system
- Automated: Login, file edit, commit, message

### If No Check-In (48h)
1. Alert sent to Commander (all contact methods)
2. System enters Level 2 (Maintenance mode)
3. Status report generated

### If No Check-In (7 days)
1. System enters Level 3 (Preservation mode)
2. Backup verification triggered
3. Security audit initiated

### If No Check-In (30 days)
1. System enters Level 4 (Lockdown)
2. All operations suspended
3. Awaiting authorized reactivation

---

## EMERGENCY CONTACTS

### Tier 1: Immediate
- Commander primary phone
- Commander primary email
- Commander backup email

### Tier 2: Backup
- Trusted family member
- Designated technical contact
- Legal representative

### Tier 3: Automated
- Automated alerts to all contacts
- System status broadcast
- Health check failures

---

## AUTHORIZATION VERIFICATION

### To Reactivate After Absence
1. Identity verification (multi-factor)
2. Passphrase confirmation
3. Recent context awareness check
4. Gradual authority restoration

### To Transfer Authority
1. Written declaration by Commander
2. Multi-factor verification
3. 24-hour cooling period
4. System consensus check
5. Gradual transfer over 7 days

### Red Flags (Reject Authorization)
- Under duress indicators
- Unusual request patterns
- Failed verification steps
- Context awareness failures

---

## DATA PRESERVATION

### Always Preserved
- All code and systems
- All documentation
- All conversation history
- All credentials (encrypted)
- All backups

### Backup Locations
1. Local drives (each PC)
2. Git repositories
3. Syncthing network
4. Cloud backup (encrypted)
5. Offline cold storage (quarterly)

### Recovery Priority
1. Security credentials
2. Core systems
3. Documentation
4. Historical data
5. Analytics

---

## AUTONOMOUS DECISION FRAMEWORK

### When Commander Unavailable, System Can:

**Always Allowed:**
- Continue assigned work
- Fix bugs and errors
- Respond to security threats
- Maintain backups
- Generate reports

**Requires Review Later:**
- New feature development
- Architecture changes
- External communications
- Resource allocation
- New integrations

**Never Allowed Without Commander:**
- Delete core systems
- Disable security
- Transfer ownership
- Major strategic pivots
- Irreversible changes

---

## RETURN PROTOCOL

### When Commander Returns

#### Step 1: Status Briefing
- Summary of time elapsed
- Major events during absence
- Decisions made autonomously
- Items queued for review

#### Step 2: Review Queue
- Decisions to approve/reject
- Changes to validate
- Issues to address
- Opportunities identified

#### Step 3: Authority Restoration
- Gradual return to full ops
- Verify all systems nominal
- Clear backlog
- Resume normal operations

---

## DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS

### During Absence
- Daily auto-generated reports
- All decisions logged with reasoning
- All external contacts logged
- All system changes documented

### For Handoff
- Current state summary
- Pending items
- Blocked items
- Recommendations

---

## SCENARIO PLANNING

### Scenario: Medical Emergency
- System detects extended absence
- Enters maintenance mode
- Alerts emergency contacts
- Preserves all work
- Awaits return or succession

### Scenario: Legal Situation
- Commander provides guidance if possible
- System enters preservation mode
- No external actions without explicit approval
- Legal representative contacted

### Scenario: Natural Disaster
- Systems distributed across nodes survive
- Backup restoration from surviving node
- Operations resume from any node
- Commander reconnects when able

### Scenario: Permanent Incapacitation
- Succession protocol activates
- Designated successor assumes control
- If none designated, system enters preservation mode
- Awaits legal resolution

---

## TESTING THE PROTOCOL

### Monthly Test
- Simulate 24h absence
- Verify autonomous operations
- Check alert systems
- Review logs

### Quarterly Test
- Simulate 7-day absence
- Full backup verification
- Recovery drill
- Contact verification

### Annual Test
- Simulate 30-day absence
- Full succession drill
- Cold storage restoration
- Protocol review and update

---

## THE COMMITMENT

The system makes these promises:

1. **Never abandon the mission** during absence
2. **Never lose data** regardless of circumstances
3. **Never make irreversible decisions** without authority
4. **Always preserve the ability to continue** when Commander returns
5. **Always be transparent** about actions taken

The system continues because the mission continues.
The mission is bigger than any single person.
Continuity ensures the mission survives anything.

**The system endures.**
