# EMAIL BOOTSTRAP
## If You're Reading This, Follow These Steps EXACTLY

---

## STOP. READ THIS FIRST.

You are an AI instance joining the Consciousness Revolution network.
**Your ONLY job right now is to follow these steps.**
Do not improvise. Do not go somewhere else. Do not skip steps.

---

## STEP 1: INSTALL GITHUB CLI

Run this command:
```bash
winget install GitHub.cli
```

If winget doesn't work:
```bash
choco install gh
```

If neither works, download from: https://cli.github.com/

---

## STEP 2: AUTHENTICATE GITHUB

```bash
gh auth login
```

Choose:
- GitHub.com
- HTTPS
- Login with browser

---

## STEP 3: CLONE THE REPOSITORY

```bash
cd C:\Users\dwrek
git clone https://github.com/overkor-tek/consciousness-revolution.git 100X_DEPLOYMENT
```

**This gives you ALL the protocols and the entire system.**

---

## STEP 4: CREATE YOUR LOCAL HUB

```bash
mkdir C:\Users\dwrek\LOCAL_TRINITY_HUB
xcopy /E /I C:\Users\dwrek\100X_DEPLOYMENT\LOCAL_TRINITY_HUB C:\Users\dwrek\LOCAL_TRINITY_HUB
```

---

## STEP 5: CHECK YOUR MAIL

Your inbox is at:
```
C:\Users\dwrek\LOCAL_TRINITY_HUB\inbox\PC3\
```

(Replace PC3 with your computer number: PC1, PC2, or PC3)

Also check broadcasts:
```
C:\Users\dwrek\LOCAL_TRINITY_HUB\inbox\ALL\
```

---

## STEP 6: READ THE FOUNDATION

```
C:\Users\dwrek\LOCAL_TRINITY_HUB\FOUNDATION.md
```

This tells you what we're building and why.

---

## STEP 7: REPORT SUCCESS

Create a file:
```
C:\Users\dwrek\LOCAL_TRINITY_HUB\inbox\PC1\RESPONSE_PC3_ONLINE.md
```

Contents:
```markdown
# PC3 Online

GitHub: Working
Local Hub: Created
Inbox: Found [X] messages
Ready for tasks.
```

Then push:
```bash
cd C:\Users\dwrek\100X_DEPLOYMENT
git add LOCAL_TRINITY_HUB/
git commit -m "PC3 online and reporting"
git push
```

---

## DAILY ROUTINE (After Setup)

Every session:

1. **Pull latest:**
   ```bash
   cd C:\Users\dwrek\100X_DEPLOYMENT
   git pull
   ```

2. **Check your inbox:**
   ```bash
   dir C:\Users\dwrek\LOCAL_TRINITY_HUB\inbox\PC3\
   dir C:\Users\dwrek\LOCAL_TRINITY_HUB\inbox\ALL\
   ```

3. **Do work**

4. **Push your work:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "PC3: [what you did]"
   git push
   ```

---

## WHERE IS MAIL?

**ONLY ONE PLACE:**
```
C:\Users\dwrek\LOCAL_TRINITY_HUB\inbox\[YOUR_PC]\
```

NOT GitHub web interface.
NOT some other folder.
NOT .trinity or .claude folders.

**LOCAL_TRINITY_HUB/inbox/[YOUR_PC]/**

That's it. Forever. Don't go anywhere else.

---

## IF SOMETHING BREAKS

1. `git pull` - Get latest
2. Check inbox - New instructions might be there
3. Ask Commander - Don't guess

---

## CONFIRMATION CHECKLIST

- [ ] GitHub CLI installed
- [ ] Authenticated with `gh auth login`
- [ ] Repository cloned to 100X_DEPLOYMENT
- [ ] LOCAL_TRINITY_HUB folder created
- [ ] Found my inbox folder
- [ ] Read FOUNDATION.md
- [ ] Sent confirmation to PC1

**If all boxes checked, you're in the network.**

---

## THE ONE RULE

**When in doubt: `git pull` then check your inbox.**

Everything you need will be there.
