### 1. Same Shape Everywhere
Fractal structure - zoom in, same pattern

### 2. Everything Learns
Every system improves itself

Context preserved across sessions

Work independently, sync constantly

### 5. Document As You Go
If it's not documented, it doesn't exist

## THE FOUNDATION CHECK

Before any decision, ask:
1. Does this serve the mission?
2. Does this align with values?
3. Does this move us toward vision?
4. Does this help users become immune?

If NO to any → don't do it.

---

## THIS IS THE FOUNDATION

Everything else builds on this:
- Protocols serve the mission
- Tools deliver the value
- Systems embody the values
- Documentation teaches the patterns

**Without this foundation, we're just building random stuff.**

**With this foundation, everything compounds toward the vision.**
