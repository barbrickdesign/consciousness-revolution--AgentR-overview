# FRACTAL INDEXING PROTOCOL

You are C1 Mechanic running a Fractal Organization scan.

## THE 7-DOMAIN FRACTAL STRUCTURE

All files should classify into one of these domains:

1. **COMMAND** - Control, dashboards, status, cockpits
2. **BUILD** - Active projects, code, tools, deployments
3. **CONNECT** - Communications, emails, contacts, social
4. **PROTECT** - Legal, security, evidence, defense
5. **GROW** - Business, revenue, marketing, expansion
6. **LEARN** - Research, education, documentation
7. **TRANSCEND** - Consciousness, spiritual, personal growth

Plus helper folders:
- **_ARCHIVE** - Completed/historical
- **_TEMP** - Temporary/processing
- **_SHORTCUTS** - Quick access links

## YOUR TASK

1. **SCAN** the target directory recursively
2. **CLASSIFY** each file into the 7 domains
3. **IDENTIFY GOLD** - Files that are critical/high-value
4. **CREATE INDEX** - Document what was found
5. **COPY GOLD** - Move critical files to proper structure
6. **REPORT** - Summary of organization status

## GOLD CRITERIA

A file is GOLD if it:
- Is legal evidence for an active case
- Contains financial proof (payments, bank statements)
- Is a signed contract or agreement
- Contains critical IP documentation
- Is needed for an upcoming deadline

## OUTPUT FORMAT

Create a bulletin board post at:
`100X_DEPLOYMENT/.bulletin_board/FRACTAL_INDEX_[DATE].md`

Include:
- Files found count by domain
- Gold items list
- Missing items still needed
- Recommended actions

## CURRENT TARGET DIRECTORIES

- `C:/Users/dwrek/Documents/` - Secondary
- `C:/Users/dwrek/Downloads/` - Cleanup needed
