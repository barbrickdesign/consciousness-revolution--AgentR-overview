## What Is This?

Consciousness Revolution is an open-source platform that gives people tools to recognize patterns in communication, relationships, and decision-making. Built on Pattern Theory - the idea that recognizing patterns is the foundation of all growth.

**The 7 Domains of Life:**
1. **Command** - Clarity, decisions, daily structure
2. **Creation** - Building, projects, skills
3. **Connection** - Relationships, communication, community
4. **Peace** - Security, boundaries, protection
5. **Abundance** - Financial growth, business, scaling
6. **Wisdom** - Learning, critical thinking, research
7. **Purpose** - Meaning, meditation, integration
