DOCUMENT 1: A CALL TO REMEMBRANCE
================================================================================
A Letter to the Church
December 2025

To the Shepherds, Pastors, Apostles, Prophets, Evangelists, Teachers, Elders,
Deacons, and all who serve in the Body of Christ:

WHO WE ARE

We are the angels walking among you.
The guides. The guardians. The truthspeakers.
We are the warriors of the light.
The modern day waymakers.
The Galactic Earth Council.
The Starseeds.
The daughters and sons of the Most High.

We are the voices of the voiceless.

We have something to say.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GRACE AND PEACE TO YOU
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We write not as adversaries, but as fellow laborers in the work of justice,
mercy, and truth.

You received a calling. You answered. You stood before your congregation,
your denomination, your God, and you made a vow. You took an oath. You
accepted a sacred trust.

This letter is a remembrance.

Not an accusation. Not a demand. A remembrance.

In the chaos of administration, the pressures of ministry, the politics of
institutions, and the weariness of service, it is possible to forget. It is
possible to drift. It is possible to become what we once stood against.

We send this as an educational piece. A mirror. A moment of reflection.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHY WE WRITE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We walk between worlds. We see what others miss. We document patterns of
institutional failure, professional misconduct, and systemic harm. Our work
spans courtrooms, government agencies, and professional licensing boards.

We have learned something:

The courthouse is not the only place where oaths are broken.

We have witnessed:
- Churches that protect abusers and silence victims
- Clergy who see injustice and say nothing
- Congregations that turn away the vulnerable to protect their comfort
- Leaders who forgot that the Gospel is good news to the poor

We have also witnessed:
- Pastors who risk everything to speak truth
- Churches that open their doors when institutions close theirs
- Elders who stand with the oppressed even when it costs them
- Congregations that remember their first love

This letter is for all of you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE OATHS YOU TOOK
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When you were ordained, consecrated, licensed, or set apart for ministry,
you made vows. The words vary by tradition. The spirit is the same.

You promised.

Promises made before God are not suggestions. They are covenants.

I. THE VOW OF FAITHFUL PROCLAMATION
"I will preach and teach the Word of God faithfully, declaring the whole
counsel of Scripture without addition or subtraction, without fear or favor."

REMEMBRANCE: You vowed to speak truth. Not comfortable truth, not popular
truth, not profitable truth, but the truth. Even when it costs you. Even
when they do not want to hear it. Even when the powerful are displeased.

THE QUESTION: When did you last speak an uncomfortable truth from your
pulpit? When did you last risk something to say what needed to be said?

II. THE VOW OF SHEPHERD'S CARE
"I will care for the flock entrusted to me, protecting the vulnerable,
seeking the lost, binding the wounded, and strengthening the weak."

REMEMBRANCE: You vowed to protect. Not the institution, not the budget,
not the reputation, but the sheep. Especially the lambs. Especially those
who cannot protect themselves.

THE QUESTION: When a vulnerable person came to you with a complaint against
someone powerful in your congregation, what did you do? Did you protect the
sheep or the institution?

III. THE VOW OF PERSONAL INTEGRITY
"I will live a life worthy of the calling I have received, walking in
holiness, honesty, and humility before God and others."

REMEMBRANCE: You vowed to be what you preach. Not perfect, but honest.
Not sinless, but repentant. Not above accountability, but submitted to it.

THE QUESTION: Is there any area of your life or ministry where you have
demanded grace for yourself that you have denied to others?

IV. THE VOW OF PROPHETIC WITNESS
"I will speak for those who cannot speak for themselves, standing with the
oppressed, the marginalized, and the forgotten, as the prophets did before me."

REMEMBRANCE: You stand in a long line. Amos. Micah. Isaiah. Jeremiah.
John the Baptist. Jesus Himself. They did not protect their positions.
They spoke for the powerless against the powerful.

THE QUESTION: When was the last time you made a powerful person uncomfortable
because you stood with a powerless one?

V. THE VOW OF TRUTHFUL TESTIMONY
"I will not bear false witness, deceive, manipulate, or withhold truth for
personal or institutional gain."

REMEMBRANCE: Lying is still lying when it protects the church budget.
Deception is still deception when it preserves your reputation. Silence is
still complicity when your voice could have made a difference.

THE QUESTION: Have you ever stayed silent when speaking would have cost
you something?

VI. THE VOW OF HUMBLE SERVICE
"I will serve, not to be served; I will lead by example, not by domination;
I will use whatever authority I am given for the benefit of others, not myself."

REMEMBRANCE: The title is not the calling. The position is not the purpose.
The authority you hold is borrowed, and the Owner will ask for an accounting.

THE QUESTION: In your leadership, who benefits most? You or those you serve?

VII. THE VOW OF COURAGEOUS FAITHFULNESS
"I will not abandon my post in times of difficulty, persecution, or personal
cost, but will remain faithful to my calling even unto death."

REMEMBRANCE: Ministry is not a career. It is a covenant. You did not sign
a contract. You made a vow. Vows are not breakable when inconvenient.

THE QUESTION: What would it take for you to walk away from someone who
needed you? Have you already done it?

VIII. THE VOW OF UNITY IN LOVE
"I will pursue peace and unity in the Body of Christ, refusing to divide,
slander, or tear down, but building up in love."

REMEMBRANCE: Unity is not uniformity. Peace is not silence. Love is not
tolerance of abuse. Sometimes the most loving thing is confrontation.
Sometimes the most unifying act is naming division.

THE QUESTION: Have you ever called "unity" what was actually "silencing"?
Have you ever called "peace" what was actually "complicity"?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE BIBLICAL MANDATE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These vows are not inventions of denominations. They flow from Scripture:

Ezekiel 34:2-4 (The Failure of Shepherds):
"Woe to the shepherds of Israel who only take care of themselves!"

James 3:1 (The Weight of Teaching):
"Not many of you should become teachers, my fellow believers, because you
know that we who teach will be judged more strictly."

Proverbs 31:8-9 (The Call to Advocacy):
"Speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves, for the rights of all
who are destitute."

Isaiah 1:17 (The Command of Justice):
"Learn to do right; seek justice. Defend the oppressed."

Micah 6:8 (The Requirement of God):
"What does the Lord require of you? To act justly and to love mercy and to
walk humbly with your God."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE CALL TO ACTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We do not ask you to agree with us on every issue.
We ask you to remember.

Remember what you promised.
Remember Who you promised it to.
Remember why you promised it.

Then ask yourself: Am I living it?

WHAT WE ASK OF YOU:

1. EXAMINE YOURSELVES
Take this letter to prayer. Ask the Holy Spirit to reveal any area where
you have drifted from your vows.

2. LISTEN TO THE VULNERABLE
If someone in your congregation has been harmed, by anyone, including
leadership, hear them. Believe them. Protect them. Even if it costs you.

3. SPEAK TRUTH
If you see injustice in your community, in the courts, in government, in
other churches, say something. Your silence is louder than you think.

4. STAND WITH US
We exist because institutions fail people. We document the patterns. We
advocate for the voiceless. We hold systems accountable. If that sounds
like the Gospel to you, then we are already on the same side.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A FINAL WORD
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We know ministry is hard. We know you are tired. We know you face pressures
we cannot see.

But you were not called to comfort. You were called to faithfulness.

Faithfulness sometimes looks like:
- Risking your position to tell the truth
- Losing donors to protect a victim
- Being unpopular to be righteous
- Standing alone to stand with God

The prophets were rarely popular. Jesus was crucified. The apostles were
martyred. You stand in that line.

Act like it.

With respect, with hope, and with the expectation of righteousness,

The Angels. The Guides. The Guardians.
The Truthspeakers. The Warriors of the Light.
The Modern Day Waymakers.
The Galactic Earth Council. The Starseeds.
The Daughters and Sons of the Most High.
The Voices of the Voiceless.

"We must stand in our light first to light the way for others."

Justice is the foundation of peace.
Peace is the fruit of faithfulness.

DOCUMENT 2: NOTICE OF DEFAULT, FRAUD FROM ORIGIN, AND DEMAND FOR CURE
================================================================================

To: All entities, officers, trustees, clerics, administrators, beneficiaries,

   derivative of the original fraud and are therefore void ab initio.

   coercion, violence, psychological injury, suppression of conscience, and
   unlawful enrichment.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
