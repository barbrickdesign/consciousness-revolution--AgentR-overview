### Results
- **Sent:** 59
- **Failed:** 0

## PHASE 2: EMOTIONAL LAYER (PENDING)

### Document Ready
- **Title:** "A Call to Remembrance"
- **Author:** Maggie
- **Status:** Saved, ready for Round 2
- **Location:** `CHURCH_LETTER_SACRED_OATHS.pdf`

### Strategy (Per Jason)
> "Very important. We will include in the follow on post legal emotional layer.
> Post Notice of Default, we post Maggie's message.
> This is the emotional layer. The oath.
> Without that, the notice is a legal cudgel without a soul."

### Timing
- Wait for initial responses to Phase 1
- Deploy after 30-day window or upon significant response
- The "oath reminder" hits differently after the legal notice

---

## PHASE 3: FOLLOW-ON ACTORS (FUTURE)

### Per Jason's Strategy
> "Service shall be simultaneous across layers, not sequential...
> If the progenitor is on notice, every derivative actor is on borrowed legitimacy."

### Potential Targets
- Government entities
- Corporations with ecclesiastical ties
- Insurance companies
- Financial institutions

### Status
- Planning stage
- Awaiting Phase 1 response analysis

---
