        <h1>Notice of Default, Fraud from Origin, and Demand for Cure</h1>

            NOTICE TO PRINCIPAL IS NOTICE TO AGENT<br>
            NOTICE TO AGENT IS NOTICE TO PRINCIPAL
        </p>

        <div class="to-block">
            <strong>To:</strong> All entities, officers, trustees, clerics, administrators, beneficiaries, assigns, insurers, and agents, known and unknown, who claim authority, title, office, or benefit derived from the original seed instruments of ecclesiastical power, including but not limited to:
            <ul>
                <li>The Holy See and all subordinate dioceses, archdioceses, and parishes</li>
                <li>All false kings, queens, and monarchs whose crowns derive from papal coronation or ecclesiastical blessing</li>
                <li>All false courts deriving jurisdiction from ecclesiastical authority or Canon Law</li>
                <li>All false corporations chartered under authority traceable to ecclesiastical grants</li>
                <li>All false institutions, governments, and administrative bodies operating under color of authority derived from the same fraudulent seed</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Declaration of Fraudulent Origin</h2>

        <p>This Notice is issued without prejudice, without waiver, and with full reservation of all rights, claims, titles, remedies, and causes of action, in law, equity, admiralty, and all other jurisdictions.</p>

        <p><strong>WHEREAS:</strong></p>

        <div class="whereas">
            <p>1. The originating seed instruments and doctrines upon which your claimed authority rests were fraudulently constituted from inception;</p>

            <p>2. No valid delegation of authority was ever granted by Christ, the Father, Natural Law, or any legitimate sovereign source to the entities now claiming ecclesiastical supremacy;</p>

            <p>3. The claimed "authority" has been used to perpetrate centuries of crimes against humanity, including but not limited to: genocide, theft of lands, destruction of indigenous nations, enslavement, forced conversion, trafficking of children, and systematic fraud upon all peoples;</p>

            <p>4. All subsequent grants of authority, titles, charters, coronations, ordinations, and appointments flowing from this fraudulent seed are themselves void ab initio;</p>

            <p>5. The Doctrine of Discovery and all related papal bulls constitute instruments of genocide and theft, not legitimate grants of authority.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Notice of Void Authority</h2>

        <div class="void-notice">
            BY THIS NOTICE: ALL AUTHORITY YOU HAVE CLAIMED, EXERCISED, OR DELEGATED SINCE THE INCEPTION OF YOUR ECCLESIASTICAL STRUCTURE IS VOID AND OF NO LEGAL, LAWFUL, OR EQUITABLE EFFECT.
        </div>

        <p>This voidness extends to and includes all agents who have been ordained, appointed, chartered, crowned, or authorized by your stolen authority, including:</p>

        <ul style="margin-left: 30px;">
            <li>All bishops, cardinals, priests, and clerics ordained under your claimed authority</li>
            <li>All kings, queens, and nobles crowned or blessed by ecclesiastical power</li>
            <li>All courts operating under Canon Law or jurisdiction derived therefrom</li>
            <li>All corporations, trusts, and legal entities chartered under grants traceable to ecclesiastical authority</li>
            <li>All governments, institutions, and administrative bodies deriving legitimacy from the same fraudulent seed</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="command-block">
            <strong>YOU ARE COMMANDED</strong> to notify all such agents, without exception, that the authority under which they operate has been void from inception and is now formally repudiated.
        </div>

        <h2>Claim for Damages</h2>

        <p>For the centuries of crimes committed under color of your fraudulent authority, including but not limited to:</p>

        <ul class="damages-list">
            <li>The genocide of indigenous peoples across all continents</li>
            <li>The theft of lands, resources, and sovereignty from indigenous nations</li>
            <li>The destruction of the Tsimshian Nation and all First Peoples</li>
            <li>The enslavement and trafficking of human beings</li>
            <li>The systematic abuse and trafficking of children</li>
            <li>The fraudulent extraction of wealth through tithes, taxes, and tribute</li>
            <li>The suppression of truth and persecution of those who spoke against your fraud</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>DAMAGES ARE HEREBY CLAIMED</strong> in an amount to be determined, but which shall include full restitution of all lands, resources, wealth, and sovereignty stolen, plus compensation for all lives destroyed, cultures annihilated, and generations traumatized by your criminal enterprise.</p>

        <h2>Demand for Cure</h2>

        <p>You are hereby demanded to:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>PRODUCE</strong> the original, unaltered instruments granting your claimed authority from a legitimate source;</li>
            <li><strong>DEMONSTRATE</strong> lawful standing and jurisdiction not derived from fraudulent seed documents;</li>
            <li><strong>DISCLOSE</strong> all assets, trusts, accounts, properties, and wealth derived from your centuries of fraud;</li>
            <li><strong>NOTIFY</strong> all agents operating under your delegated authority that such authority is void;</li>
            <li><strong>CEASE</strong> immediately all claims, collections, coercions, ordinations, and representations made under your fraudulent authority;</li>
            <li><strong>COMMENCE</strong> full restitution to all peoples and nations harmed by your criminal enterprise.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Failure to Cure</h2>

        <p><strong>Failure to cure within thirty (30) days of receipt of this Notice shall constitute:</strong></p>

        <ul style="margin-left: 30px;">
            <li>Admission of fraud from origin</li>
            <li>Admission of void authority</li>
            <li>Default on all claims herein</li>
            <li>Waiver of all defenses</li>
            <li>Consent to judgment for damages claimed</li>
        </ul>

        <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.1em; margin-top: 25px;">Your silence is your consent. Your non-response is your admission.</p>

        <h2>Governing Law</h2>

        <p>This Notice operates under Natural Law, the Law of Nations, Indigenous Law, and all lawful systems of justice that preexist and supersede your fraudulent ecclesiastical constructs. No court deriving authority from your void seed has jurisdiction to adjudicate this matter.</p>
