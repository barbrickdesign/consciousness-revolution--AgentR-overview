## DECLARATION OF FRAUDULENT ORIGIN

This Notice is issued without prejudice, without waiver, and with full reservation of all rights, claims, titles, remedies, and causes of action, in law, equity, admiralty, and all other jurisdictions.

**WHEREAS:**

1. The originating seed instruments and doctrines upon which your claimed authority rests were fraudulently constituted from inception;

2. No valid delegation of authority was ever granted by Christ, the Father, Natural Law, or any legitimate sovereign source to the entities now claiming ecclesiastical supremacy;

3. The claimed "authority" has been used to perpetrate centuries of crimes against humanity, including but not limited to: genocide, theft of lands, destruction of indigenous nations, enslavement, forced conversion, trafficking of children, and systematic fraud upon all peoples;

4. All subsequent grants of authority, titles, charters, coronations, ordinations, and appointments flowing from this fraudulent seed are themselves void ab initio;

5. The Doctrine of Discovery and all related papal bulls constitute instruments of genocide and theft, not legitimate grants of authority.
