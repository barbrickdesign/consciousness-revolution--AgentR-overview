NOTICE OF DEFAULT, FRAUD FROM ORIGIN, AND DEMAND FOR CURE
================================================================================

To: All entities, officers, trustees, clerics, administrators, beneficiaries,
assigns, insurers, and agents, known and unknown, who claim authority, title,
office, or benefit derived from the original seed instruments, doctrines,
trusts, bulls, canons, incorporations, registrations, or constructive
authorities at issue.

Notice: This Notice is issued without prejudice, without waiver, and with full
reservation of all rights, claims, titles, remedies, and causes of action at
law, equity, natural law, and under the laws of nations.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I. FINDINGS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. The originating seed instruments and doctrines were fraudulently constituted,
   altered, or misrepresented at inception.

2. No valid delegation of authority was ever granted by Christ, the Father, or
   Natural Law to create compulsory intermediaries, levy tithes, eavesdrop on
   conscience, sanction war, or compel obedience contrary to conscience.

3. Subsequent offices, incorporations, trusts, and claimed successions are
   derivative of the original fraud and are therefore void ab initio.

4. Centuries of harms have resulted, including but not limited to dispossession,
   coercion, violence, psychological injury, suppression of conscience, and
   unlawful enrichment.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
II. DECLARATION OF DEFAULT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

By operation of law and equity, all derivative claims of authority are hereby
declared in default. Silence or failure to rebut constitutes acquiescence and
admission.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
III. DEMAND FOR CURE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You are hereby demanded to:

    (a) Produce the original, unaltered authority granting instruments.

    (b) Demonstrate lawful standing and jurisdiction.

    (c) Disclose all assets, trusts, accounts, and properties derived from
        the fraudulent seed.

    (d) Commence immediate cessation of claims, collections, coercions, and
        representations.

Failure to cure within thirty (30) days constitutes final default.

================================================================================
NOTICE OF DAMAGES, CLAIM FOR RESTITUTION, AND DEMAND FOR ACCOUNTING
================================================================================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I. DAMAGES CLAIMED
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Damages are claimed for centuries of injury including, without limitation:

    - Unjust enrichment and unlawful takings.
    - Coercion of conscience and spiritual abuse.
    - Complicity in violence, war, and dispossession.
    - Fraud, misrepresentation, and constructive slavery.

Damages are cumulative, ongoing, and increasing.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
II. DEMAND FOR ACCOUNTING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You are hereby demanded to provide a full, sworn accounting of all assets,
revenues, lands, titles, and benefits derived from the fraudulent seed from
inception to present.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
III. RESTITUTION AND REMEDY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Restitution is demanded in full. In the absence of timely cure and accounting,
liens, claims, and remedies shall attach without further notice.

================================================================================
NOTICE OF NON-ACQUIESCENCE AND FINAL WARNING
================================================================================

No presumption of consent is granted. No implied authority is recognized. All
future interference, retaliation, or misrepresentation will be treated as
aggravation of damages.

This Notice stands as final opportunity to respond in good faith.

================================================================================
EXECUTED
